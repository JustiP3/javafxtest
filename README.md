"#Javafxtest" 
Still trying to figure out github.
the only file that was supposed to be in this repository was the javafxtest folder.
I tried to push this project from the eclipse plugin just after trying to push my other project(Searchbystocknumber) from the command line and I imagine that has something to do with why these other files are now here.
